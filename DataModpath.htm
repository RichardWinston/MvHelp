<h1>MODPATH Data Requirements</h1>

<p>
Date requirements for visualizing MODPATH results are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Pathlines should be tracked in the direction of flow (forward tracking).
<li>Pathlines should be saved as a standard or compact text file.
</ul>

<h3>Note:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Model Viewer does not display pathlines by themselves. Instead,
the pathline file may be loaded as an optional file along with results
from the following models: MODFLOW-2000, MODFLOW-2000 GWT, MODFLOW-96,
MOC3D, and MT3DMS. <u>The pathline file must be place in the same folder as the
"name file" for the model</u>.
</ul>
