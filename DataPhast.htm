<h1>PHAST Data Requirements</h1>

<p>
  Data requirements for visualizing PHAST results are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  Only data that is stored within the HDF output file (<i>prefix.</i><b>h5</b>)
  can be displayed within Model Viewer.
</li>
<li>
  Writing of initial-condition heads and chemical data is controlled by the identifiers
  <b>-HDF_heads</b> and <b>-HDF_chemistry</b> in the <b>PRINT_INITIAL</b> data block.
  By default, initial-condition heads and chemical data are written to the file.
</li>
<li>
  If steady-state flow is simulated, the steady-state velocities at nodes can be written
  to the HDF file by using the <b>-HDF_steady_flow_velocities</b> identifier of the
  <b>PRINT_INITIAL</b> data block. By default, steady-state flow velocities are not
  written to the file.
</li>

<li>
  During the simulation, heads, nodal velocities, and chemical data are written at
  selected frequencies as defined by the <b>-HDF_heads</b>, <b>-HDF_velocities</b>, and
  <b>-HDF_chemistry</b> identifiers in the <b>PRINT_FREQUENCY</b> data block. By default,
  the heads, velocities, and chemistry data are written to the HDF file at the end of
  each simulation period.  If steady-state flow is simulated, the heads and velocities
  will be written only once. The chemical data to be written to the HDF file are
  defined in the <b>SELECTED_OUTPUT</b> data block of the chemistry data file and by
  Basic-language programs in the <b>USER_PUNCH</b> data block of the chemistry data file.
</li>

</ul>
