<h1>MT3DMS Data Requirements</h1>

<p>
Date requirements for visualizing MT3DMS results are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The input parameter 
<A HREF="JavaScript:popup.TextPopup(cinact,PopupFont,9,9,-1,-1)">CINACT</a>
must be assigned a value that is different 
from simulated concentration at active cells. (<A href="#note1">See note 1 below.</a>)
<li>The input parameter 
<A HREF="JavaScript:popup.TextPopup(savucn,PopupFont,9,9,-1,-1)">SAVUCN</a>
must be set to T in order to save concentrations.
<li>Concentrations must be save at one or more transport 
  time steps.          
</ul>

<h3>Note:</h3>

<ol>
<a name="note1"></a><li>If the simulated concentration at a cell is equal to 
  CINACT, Model Viewer assumes that the cell is inactive and will not display 
  it. Therefore, the common practice of setting CINACT to zero should be avoided 
  if concentrations at active cells might also be zero. Another consideration is 
  to avoid truncation error. For example, setting CINACT to 99.999 should be 
  avoided because the output might not be written with adequate precision. 
  Instead, it is recommended that CINACT be set to a large negative integer such 
  as <nobr>-1.0E10</nobr>.         
              
            
          
          
             
          
       
</ol>
