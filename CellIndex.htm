<h1>The i-j-k Index System for Cells</h1>


<p align="center"><IMG src="cellindex.bmp"></p>

<ul>
<li>For <b>finite-difference</b> models (MODFLOW-2000, MODFLOW-2000 GWT, MODFLOW-96, MOC3D, and MT3DMS)


    <ul>
    <li>The index i runs along a row.
    <li>The index j runs along a column.
    <li>The index k increases from one layer to the next, 
    counting from bottom to top. Note that this is opposite to the MODFLOW 
    convention in which layers are counted from top to bottom.</li>     
    </ul>
    
<li>For the <b>finite-element</b> model SUTRA
    <ul>
    <li>The index i runs along the "first numbering direction"
    <li>The index j runs along the "second numbering direction"
    <li>The index k runs along the "third numbering direction"
    </ul>

</ul>
