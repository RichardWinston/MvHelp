<h1>The MV File</h1>

<ul>
<li>The <b>MV file</b> is used by Model Viewer to keep track 
of the model data and display settings for a particular set of
simulation results (model run). This file has a name 
that ends with <b><i>.mv</i></b>.

<li>The <b>New</b>, <b>Open</b>, <b>Close</b>, <b>Save</b> and 
<b>Save As</b> commands (under the <b>File</b> menu) operate on MV files. 

<li>The <b>New</b> command begins the process of creating a new MV file.
You will be asked to <A href="LoadModelData.htm">load model data</A>.

<li>When you <b>save</b> an MV file, Model Viewer writes the following 
information to disk: the type of model, the names of model data files, 
and all current display settings. Note that the MV file does not contain the 
actual model data.

<li>The MV file for a particular model run must be save to a specific folder:
    <ul>
    <li>For MODFLOW-2000, MODFLOW-2000 GWT, MODFLOW-96, and MOC3D, the MV file
    must be save to folder containing the "name" file.
    <li>For MT3DMS, the MV file must be saved to the folder 
    containing the "cnf" file.</li>              
    <li>For SUTRA, the MV file must be saved to the folder containing the "nod" file.
    </ul>
    
<li>When you <b>open</b> an MV file, Model Viewer loads the model data and sets 
the display according to the information saved in the MV file. 

<li>When you <b>close</b> an MV file, Model Viewer terminates the display of data. 
The program window becomes blank. The Close command is useful during repeated
cycles of running a model and viewing the results. While model results are 
displayed in Model Viewer, the model data files cannot be over-written 
by another program. Closing the MV file releases the model data files 
so that the model can run to generate a new set of results.

<li>Every time you change a display setting (for example, the 
  color bar limits), the current MV file is considered to have been changed. If 
  you did not saved the MV file after the changes, and you try to (a) create a 
  new MV file, or (b) close the current MV file, or (c) exit Model Viewer, you 
  will be prompted to save the MV file before continuing.</li>
